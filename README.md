## Setup your repository to have the workflow
The action is not published anywhere so you will have to get it by hand.
Either fork this repository if you don't have it, or follow those steps if you're like me and already have it inside your account:
```
git clone git@github.com:Graygzou/advent-of-code-template.git
cd advent-of-code-template
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Graygzou/advent-of-code-20XX // Don't forget to change the year here.
git push origin master
```
You can also get the files one by one by hand if you wish. But at your own risk.

## Disclaimer

:warning: Please, use my solutions only if you've already try solving the puzzle by yourself first.   
You will learn so much more by doing it that way, instead of looking at an already made solution or even worse, caring only for the result.

## Metrics

Here are some overall details about each solution. I used GitHub actions to generate it automatically.

Those metrics should be taken with a grain of salt since I did not use rigorous benchmark technics (like running several times the program and taking the mean out of all the results)
